Connect Four 

Connect Four is a grid-based game where players alternate dropping colored discs into columns on a 7x6 grid, aiming to align four discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This project uses OOP to manage game states, board setup, and turn-based interactions, demonstrating the implementation of game rules in a structured, maintainable codebase.

Tic Tac Toe 

A classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python using Object-Oriented Programming. This game allows two players to alternate turns, marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one player aligns three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The project showcases OOP concepts such as encapsulation and modular design, making the game logic reusable and easy to understand.
