Connect Four
Connect Four is a grid-based game where players alternate dropping colored discs into columns on a 7x6 grid, aiming to align four discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This project uses OOP to manage game states, board setup, and turn-based interactions, demonstrating the implementation of game rules in a structured, maintainable codebase.
